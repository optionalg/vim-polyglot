A solid yet lightweight language pack for Vim.

As plugin evolves really quickly, I found updating releases here very time consuming,
unfortunately vim.org doesn't allow for removing already added plugins.

Please visit source repository for installation instructions and releases in .zip format.
I'll try to post here updates only for major releases, though.
